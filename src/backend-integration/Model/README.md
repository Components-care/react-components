# Models

## Purpose

Models define a database schema used in the frontend.
The model provides meta information about each database field including information such as [visibility](Visibilities/README.md), default value, validation rules and [rendering info](Types/Renderers/README.md).
The model also provides easy access to [react-query](https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-query) hooks which enable backend data fetching as well as manipulation and deletion.
